# Motor-Trend-Shiny-Prediction
Coursera Data Products Project

This shiny application has been developed for the purposes of the Coursera Developing data products course project.
Data used are from 'mtcars' dataset in R, which contains information on technical characteristics of vehicles as published in motor trend magazine.
In the application developed the user can insert in left panel numerical values for vehicle horsepower, number of cylinders and vehicle weight. The application uses appropriate linear regression algorithms to predict fuel consumption for automatic and manual transmission vehicles. The results are shown both in numbers and in bar charts in the right panel of the application.
